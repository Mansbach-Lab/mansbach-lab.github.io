Our lab mate Vrinda has published an excellent article on **Proteins as Biomarkers** for Proteo.ca! 

In this piece, Vrinda explores how proteins serve as crucial molecular indicators in medical diagnosis and treatment, acting as the unsung heroes that help clinicians make informed decisions about patient care.

## Key Highlights:

The article delves into:
- How proteins function as reliable biomarkers in disease detection
- The role of protein biomarkers in personalized medicine
- Current applications and future potential in clinical diagnostics
- The intersection of proteomics research and practical healthcare solutions

This work showcases the important translational aspects of our research and demonstrates how fundamental protein science directly impacts patient outcomes.
