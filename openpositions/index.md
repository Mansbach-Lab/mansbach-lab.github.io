# Mansbach Lab Open Positions

There are currently two open positions in our lab for MSc or PhD students with a strong physics and computational background. The most important skills we are looking for are statistical mechanics and machine learning.

## Generative Deep Learning for understanding long COVID

We have one open position in the [Mansbach Lab](https://mansbach-lab.github.io/) for Winter 2024 or Fall 2024. This is part of a unique joint project with collaborators in medical physics, journalism, and history, but the primary supervision would be from Dr. Mansbach.

## Computational Modeling of Photosynthetic Pigment-protein Complexes

We have one open position for a co-supervised position between the [Mansbach](https://mansbach-lab.github.io/) and [Zazubovits](https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/physics/research/zazubovits-research-group.html) Labs in the Physics Department at Concordia University for Winter 2024 or Fall 2024.
