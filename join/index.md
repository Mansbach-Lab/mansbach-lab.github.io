We are often in the market for motivated and talented people, even if we do not have an open position currently advertised. We are interested in engaging you in a conversation about your scientific background and goals for your future career (in academia, industry, or other ventures). We strive to provide excellent training across a wide range of computational and experimental techniques. If interested please send your CV/Resume to [Ré Mansbach](/contact/).

## Graduate Students

Graduate students at Concordia can apply to the [physics program](https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/physics/programs/graduate.html) but must secure a supervisor themselves. There are currently [open positions](/openpositions/) in our lab for Canadian MSc students and Canadian or international PhD students with a strong physics and computational background. The most important skills we are looking for are statistical mechanics and machine learning.

## Postdoctoral Fellows

Inquiries about Postdoctoral positions should be emailed directly to Ré Mansbach. <!--We set our postdoctoral fellow compensation to the [Stanford rates](https://postdocs.stanford.edu/funding-levels-and-guidelines) **and** encourage candidates to explore applying for extramural fellowships to support their research.
//-->

## Other Visitors

We may sometimes take research assistants of various levels. Compensation is set by [TRAC (Teaching and Research Assistants at Concordia](https://trac-union.ca/pay-rates/). If you're interested, please contact me.

<!--In the past, our lab has enjoyed having foreign exchange students, interns, sabbatical visitors from academia and industry, and post-bac technicians in the lab.  We are open to other arrangements as well. As we expect people to be fairly compensated for their work by their home institution or by us, we do not have volunteer positions available. Note: we take high school students exclusively through the [UCSF SEP program](http://sep.ucsf.edu/).//-->
