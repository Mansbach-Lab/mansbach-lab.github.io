<!-- Our lab is in on the UCSF Mission Bay campus in Genentech Hall (600 16th St, San Francisco, CA 94158)
 -->

<!--### The Mission Bay Campus can be reached:  
* #### by public transportation:
  * **Option 1**: Exit BART at the 16th St Station and wait for the free UCSF Red shuttle that stops directly outside [what was once a Burger King and now has lovely graffiti](https://www.google.com/maps/@37.765092,-122.419164,3a,75y,5.38h,82.64t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sH_jzIrhuF8wnnEp0duvIEQ!2e0) (this option is only available on weekdays: [UCSF Shuttles](http://www.campuslifeservices.ucsf.edu/transportation/services/shuttles)).
  * **Option 2**: Exit BART at the 16th St Station and take the 55 Muni Bus towards Mission Bay. Exit at 16th and 4th.
  * **Option 3**: Exit BART at the Embarcadero Station and then take the MUNI T-line inbound to Sunnydale. Exit at the Mission Bay stop on 3rd Street.
  * **Option 4**: Exit Caltrain and then walk along [4th St](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Caltrain+Bike+Station,+311+Townsend+St,+San+Francisco,+CA+94107/600+16th+St,+San+Francisco,+CA,+USA/@37.7718722,-122.4005542,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x808f7fd683557039:0xcb4ed812802cede8!2m2!1d-122.395387!2d37.776552!1m5!1m1!1s0x808f7fcf1e3cc5ff:0x6e582d4a0ba7d4ca!2m2!1d-122.3922173!2d37.7671496!3e2) for about 10-15 minutes until arriving at UCSF - if the Muni is there, you can get on the T-line inbound and exit at the Mission Bay stop on 3rd Street, but this is often slower than walking.
  * **Option 5**: There are many other shuttle options on the page for [UCSF Shuttles](http://www.campuslifeservices.ucsf.edu/transportation/services/shuttles)).
* #### by car:
  * We are at 600 16th Street Street, between Owens and 4th St. There are two parking garages (please park in the  garages and not in the surface lots) on campus that are equally convenient.
  * If being dropped off (by rideshare), use 1675 Owens St, San Francisco, CA 94158 as an address. There is convenient parking circle (red star on the map below) to let a passenger out in between the Rutter center and the parking lot.

### Once on campus, proceed to Genentech Hall:
1. You will have to enter through Genentech Hall from the Koret Quad side (Red arrow on the map below)
2. Sign in at security for a meeting with Dr. James Fraser (office Genentech Hall S472E)
3. Take the elevator or staircase to the fourth floor
4. Walk west down the hall. If the floor changes colour to grey, you have gone the wrong way and are now in Byers Hall. Turn around and walk back to Genentech Hall
5. Make your second left (south) to the S401-484 neighborhood
6. James' office is through the clear doors, the lab is on your right.

## Territorial Acknowledgement Statement

We would like to begin by acknowledging that our lab at Concordia University is located on unceded Indigenous lands. The Kanien’kehá:ka Nation is recognized as the custodians of the lands and waters on which we gather. Tiohtià:ke/Montréal is historically known as a gathering place for many First Nations. Today, it is home to a diverse population of Indigenous and other peoples. We respect the continued connections with the past, present and future in our ongoing relationships with Indigenous and other peoples within the Montreal community.

Nous aimerions commencer par reconnaître que l'Université Concordia est située en territoire autochtone, lequel n’a jamais été cédé. Nous reconnaissons la nation Kanien'kehá: ka comme gardienne des terres et des eaux sur lesquelles nous nous réunissons aujourd'hui. Tiohtiá:ke / Montréal est historiquement connu comme un lieu de rassemblement pour de nombreuses Premières Nations, et aujourd'hui, une population autochtone diversifiée, ainsi que d'autres peuples, y résident. C’est dans le respect des liens avec le passé, le présent et l'avenir que nous reconnaissons les relations continues entre les Peuples Autochtones et autres personnes de la communauté montréalaise.

<!--
The Fraser lab recognizes that the University of California San Francisco sits on the unceded land of the Ramaytush Ohlone (pronounced Rah-mah-tush O-lone-ee) peoples, the original inhabitants of the San Francisco Peninsula. As settlers on this land, we want to recognize the historic, and ongoing, discrimination and violence inflicted upon Indigenous people in North America. Please read our full statement [here](/land).
